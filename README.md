# Face-Detection-Attendance-System
GUI based Face Detection Attendance System 

This program conducts automatic attendance using Face recognition and QR code detection given on a STudent's ID card.
Since there is double security due to the QR code data, people with similar facial features aren't mistaken to be the wrong person and accurate result is obtained.
